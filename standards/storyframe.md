Hi, we are Tver.io
Ambitious IT-community with local empowerment and global thinking

Our members are qualified IT-engineers, software developers,
designers, CEOs and CTOs of IT-companies.
We are a social and educational non-profit project,
all our events are free and we publish all materials at public (ะกะก).

Our mission is creating an environment for people who want
to find new ideas, abilities to grow,
new contacts or just find a profession.

Every month we hold Tver.io Meetup.
